Delegates are encouraged to answer the questions set out in the document in a precise manner in order that the issues can be narrowly defined and to assist discussion at the forthcoming WP6 meeting.
Input from WP1 will be sought to determine whether Example 4 describes a fact pattern supporting the existence of a permanent establishment under the revised Article 5 (considering the changes introduced to paragraph 4).
In respect of the  fact  patterns  covered,  there  should  be  safeguards  to  ensure  that  if  BEPS  risks  do  occur,  these  can  be effectively targeted through the application of the transfer pricing rules under the Report on Actions 8-10.
Please note that comments are not sought on the changes to the PE definitions that have been agreed under Action 7 and which were published in the 2015 Final Report: "Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status."
In order to determine which aspects of the BEPS work require additional guidance concerning the 5. issue of attribution of profits to PEs, it is necessary to understand the exact scope of the changes made to the definition of PE by the Report on Action 7.
As a result of the changes included in the Report on Action 7, the same will now be true if the enterprise carries on identical storage and delivery functions at a similar location with respect to its own goods or merchandise.
Based  on  that  analysis,  it  seems  clear  that  the  main  area  with  respect  to  which  additional guidance on the attribution of profits is required is not directly related to the changes to the definition of PE in Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention  but rather to the impact on Article 7 of the work on the part  of  the  BEPS  Action  Plan  dealing  with  transfer  pricing,  in  particular  the  work  related  to  intangibles, risk and capital under the 2015 Final Report on Actions 8-10, “Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation”.
Do  commentators  agree  with  the  view  expressed  in  paragraph  9  that  the  most  important  differences between the AOA and a pre-AOA interpretation of Article 7 relate to the issue of the recognition of “dealings” that would require a country to take account of such “notional” payments?
Profiling  the warehouse  in  this  manner  provides  a  basis  for  developing  guidance  on  the  approach  for  determining  the profits arising from the arrangements when carried out as a cost centre as part of the MNE Group's total activities.
In terms of running the business, significant  people  functions  relating  to  the  recommendation  of  levels  of  inventory  to  be  maintained  by customers and replenishment policies are performed by WRU in Country A.

This approach was adopted to overcome the perceived limitations of the analysis under Article 9 derived from the existence of legal and contractual arrangements (see paragraph 15 of the 2010 Attribution of Profits Report).
In respect of the fact patterns covered, there should be safeguards to ensure that if BEPS risks do occur, these can be effectively targeted through the application of the transfer pricing rules under the Report on Actions 8 Do delegates have any additional suggestions to prevent or reduce double taxation, improve certainty and enhance simplification?
Please note that comments are not sought on the changes to the PE definitions that have been agreed under Action 7 and which were published in the 2015 Final Report: "Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status."
As a result of the changes included in the Report on Action 7, the same will now be true if the enterprise carries on identical storage and delivery functions at a similar location with respect to its own goods or merchandise.
Based on that analysis, it seems clear that the main area with respect to which additional guidance on the attribution of profits is required is not directly related to the changes to the definition of PE in Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention but rather to the impact on Article 7 of the work on the part of the BEPS Action Plan dealing with transfer pricing, in particular the work related to intangibles, risk and capital under the 2015 Final Report on Actions 8-10, “Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation”.
This is confirmed by the fact that the part of the AOA that deals with the allocation of “free” capital to a permanent establishment was expressly included in the 2008 Commentary7 and was incorporated in the Commentary on the UN Model in Delegates are invited to provide their input on the following questions, and indicate whether these questions should be included in the Discussion Draft for public release: Do commentators agree with the view expressed in paragraph 9 that the most important differences between the AOA and a pre-AOA interpretation of Article 7 relate to the issue of the recognition of “dealings” that would require a country to take account of such “notional” payments?
The analysis performed under Article 9 determines that an arm's length compensation, considering the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed, amounts to Given that under the Article 9 analysis the inventory and credit risks are assumed by Sellco under the guidance in Section D of Chapter I, the bad debt losses, inventory losses together with warehousing costs have been attributable already to Sellco for purposes of computing its remuneration.
Profiling the warehouse in this manner provides a basis for developing guidance on the approach for determining the profits arising from the arrangements when carried out as a cost centre as part of the MNE Group's total activities.
In terms of running the business, significant people functions relating to the recommendation of levels of inventory to be maintained by customers and replenishment policies are performed by WRU in Country A.
The Secretariat considers that if Wareco were a related enterprise, and if it is assumed that the arm's length fee is 110% of its costs, there would be no difference to the outcome of the attribution of profits to the PE of WRU.
