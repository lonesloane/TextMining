{"Text": ["EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3", "Governments are seeking to innovate: in how they work, in the services they provide and how they provide them, and in how they interact with citizens, businesses and civil society. These changes are being driven by different forces, including a more globalised and networked world, rising citizen expectations, new technologies, increasingly complex problems facing governments and \u2013 particularly since the 2008 economic crisis \u2013 tight budgets. Whatever the reason, the consensus seems clear: public sector organisations need new ways of working.", "OECD framework for analysing public sector innovation", "Drawing on recent experiences in national and sub-national governments, as well as lessons from the past, the OECD has developed a framework for analysing public sector innovation. This framework looks at the organisational factors that can encourage \u2013 or hinder \u2013 innovation. First, it identifies four levels that must be considered when addressing innovation: 1) the individual innovator, 2) the organisation in which he or she operates, 3) the public sector as a whole and 4) society. The organisational factors affecting these different levels are then grouped under four themes: knowledge and learning, organisational culture, rules and processes, and organisational design. Both the levels and factors are interlinked, and the borders between them are not always clear-cut. It is important to look at them as an integrated system. This framework can guide future research, and forms the basis for the OECD \u201cInnovation Imperative: A Call to \nAction\u201d.", "Generating and sharing ideas", "The flow of information is essential for generating new ideas, and how data and knowledge are managed and shared within an organisation can support or inhibit innovation. Public sector organisations need systems to gather and manage information produced both internally and externally, including data on their own finances and overall performance, individuals\u2019 knowledge and ideas, information on the needs and demands of users, ideas from outside their organisations, etc. Increasingly, governments are using social media and crowdsourcing to interact with the public more directly, and actively seek citizens\u2019 input on how to improve public services.", "It is not enough just to gather data, however; organisations must also be able to use that information to make changes \u2013 to become learning organisations. Knowledge management can help, but it is important that the organisational culture supports continuous learning. It is also crucial to share information to increase its innovative potential, and to help spread ideas and promising practices across organisations. \nOpen Government Data and \u201cbig data\u201d initiatives offer both new sources of public sector information and new ways to share it with people and firms outside of the public sector, who may, in turn, use it to come up with new ideas, services or products.", "Empowering the workforce to innovate", "The cultural dimension of the framework looks at how to motivate and encourage people to innovate. \nWhile pay does not seem to be an important motivator of innovation in the public sector, other extrinsic rewards such as recognition, career advancement, special assignments and competitions may play a role."]}
