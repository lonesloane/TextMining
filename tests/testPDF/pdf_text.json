For each recommendation, separate space has been allocated for describing future situations or policy intentions.", "Please submit completed answers to the Secretariat by 10 November 2014.", "Name of country:", "Slovenia", "Date of approval of Phase 3 evaluation report:", "5 June 2014", "Date of information:", "10 November", "PART I: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION", "Recommendations for ensuring effective investigation, prosecution and sanctioning of foreign bribery", "Regarding the investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery, the Working Group:", "a) Recommends that Slovenia (i) seriously step up its enforcement of the foreign bribery offence and take concrete and meaningful steps to ensure that foreign bribery is an area of priority for law enforcement authorities; (ii) take concrete steps to ensure that the National Bureau of Investigation and the Special State Prosecutor\u2019s Office proactively investigate all allegations of foreign bribery; (iii) assess all credible allegations of foreign bribery and seriously investigate complaints of this crime; (iv) generate foreign bribery cases through more proactive means of detection, including through enhancing working relations with foreign law enforcement authorities and using information from diverse sources at the pre-investigative stage; [Convention Article 5; Commentary 27; 2009 Recommendation XIII and Annex I D].", "Action taken as of the date of the follow-up report to implement this recommendation:", "From a contextual viewpoint a cursory introductory sidenote is in order1: following the SLO \nPhase 3 evaluation in June there were general elections for the National Assembly of the \nRepublic of Slovenia on 13th July 2014. After the people spoke, new coalition talks began and the new prime minister was elected by the National Assembly deputies on 25 August 2014, while the new government was confirmed by the National Assembly on 18 September - all in line with constitutionally set deadlines and procedures for the formation of the government.", "As was noted in the June report (para. 83) the previous government adopted an anti-corruption action plan \u201cProgram ukrepov vlade RS za prepre\u010devanje korupcije\u201d2 in March 2014 in which it set its anti-corruption priorities and incorporated in it most of the 15-point agenda proposed by the CPC. While the new government has not yet formally decided to continue with the implementation of the action plan, the newly formed Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) was given the coordination role and has provided the information that the decision regarding the continuation of the (updated) action plan will be on the government\u2019s table shortly. There was a meeting held on 4.11.2014 with representatives from other ministries on the matter to collect an update regarding the current state of the implementation of the action plan and also to discuss possible updates, changes and revisions to the action plan itself. It was decided that relevant additional suggestions will be brought to the attention of the MPA in the shortest possible time (an update will be provided as soon as one is received from the MPA by the time of the \nDecember plenary OECD WGB session).", "What is also worth pointing out is that MPA had a meeting on 5.11.2014 with the representatives of Transparency International Slovenia. As MPA pointed out TI Slovenia is expected to cooperate closely with MPA in the future implementation of the updated action plan.", "The forthcoming update of the action plan will be an important indicator of the new government\u2019s anti-corruption commitments in general, but also with respect to combating foreign bribery in particular. Given that MPA has been asked to join the CPC\u2019s OECD WGB coordination group (the group currently consists of representatives from judiciary, prosecution, police, SLO tax authority, Ministry of justice and the CPC) it is to be expected that the update of the action plan will adequately address the problem of foreign bribery as one of its priorities.", "In addition there were meaningful activities undertaken by the Ministry of foreign affairs (MFA). A meeting organised at the initiative of the MFA took place on 15.5.2014 with the CPC and the Office for the oversight of the state budget where concrete actions were agreed in terms of stepping\u2013up the implementation of the OECD Anti-bribery convention. Particularly pertaining to Recommendation 4a (iv) was the preparation of a note to Slovenian diplomatic missions reminding them of their obligations stemming from article 145 of the Slovene Criminal procedure Act in connection to obligations from the Anti-bribery convention. The elections and the change of government caused a slight delay in the implementation of agreed upon actions.3 \nThe CPC raised the issue of the implementation of the agreed upon measures in the preparation for the December follow-up and received a draft of the note to be sent for comments prepared by MFA on 3.11.2014. In the draft MFA underlines SLO obligations under the Anti-bribery \nConvention, brings the June Phase 3 Recommendations by the OECD WGB to the attention of our diplomatic missions, points out the need for proactive enforcement of the Convention and gives a set of instructions to the people working at our diplomatic missions on how to proceed and whom to transmit information about possible corrupt practices, informing them also of a dedicated (police) website for bribery allegations allowing anonymous notifications of suspicions regarding corrupt practices. (An update will be provided as soon as one is received from the MFA by the time of the December plenary OECD WGB session on when the final version of the note will have been sent out to our diplomatic missions).", "In the short timespan from taking office, the new government has therefore already begun activities to step up its enforcement of the foreign bribery offence and take concrete and meaningful steps to ensure that foreign bribery is an area of priority for law enforcement authorities. As will be presented, the latter have not been idly waiting for the new government, but have, as much as their independent status allows them and within their competencies, already taken concrete and meaningful steps themselves. As most of the Recommendation 4a is directed primarily towards SLO prosecution service, their concrete steps are presented first.", "As a response to the recommendations of OCED Working Group on Bribery in International \nBusiness Transactions Office of the State Prosecutor General issued a special call to Heads of all District State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices and to Head of Specialised State Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Republic of Slovenia regarding prosecution of foreign bribery cases. In this call, Deputy \nProsecutor General of Republic of Slovenia emphasised the fact, that foreign bribery represent criminal offences with elements of corruption and that these criminal offences should be regarded as priority in accordance with the existing Prosecution Policy of State Prosecutor \nGeneral. All measures necessary should be therefore taken to ensure that such matters are subject to quality and priority investigation. Deputy State Prosecutor General especially stressed that the heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices are competent to issue general instructions for implementing the Prosecution Policy. Further on, Deputy State Prosecutor \nGeneral emphasised that heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices have the competence to determine the type of matters and the method of informing on the cases in which state prosecutors must submit to the head a draft of their act for inspection in order to provide the efficiency and uniformity of prosecution. He instructed heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices to apply all these instruments with regard to foreign bribery cases with aim of assuring more proactive detection and more effective prosecution.4", "The State Prosecutor General is competent to supervise implementation of administrative matters of all State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices. In that light the content of the aforementioned call should be regarded as an order to the heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices, to handle matters of corruption, especially matters of foreign bribery, as priority. If the matter is regarded as priority this means that it should be investigated with priority and that additional system of checks of the prosecutorial decision is activated. This additional system of checks is aimed at ensuring greater transparency and quality control in such cases.", "Heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices were specifically asked to ensure that allegations of foreign bribery would be proactively investigated, as matters of priority. They were also specifically called to request prosecutors in such cases to act more actively by providing guidance to the police. Heads of State Prosecutor\u2019s Offices were especially alerted to encourage state prosecutors to make more active use of mutual legal assistance.", "Moreover the Office of the State prosecutor General provided the following status report on the cases that were identified as relevant by the OECD WGB at the June 2014 plenary (goes to subheading (ii) and (iii) of Recommendation 4a):", "During the Phase 3 evaluation, the prosecution service of Slovenia received a lawsuit, which was brought in action by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before the court of State Party to the Convention against the company XX, with headquarters in the same \nState Party of the Convention. Specialized State Prosecution of the Republic of Slovenia received this lawsuit from Office of the State Prosecutor General on 11 June 2014. The case was registered as a priority case. State prosecutor sent a request to Slovenian National \nDesk at Eurojust on 20 June 2014, asking for information from judicial authorities of foreign country (in which alleged offence took place) on possible criminal allegations relating to this case. Specialized State Prosecution received an answer from Slovenian National Desk at \nEurojust on 1 July 2014 that no such case against company XX has been registered in that country. Authorities of this country would be able to give more precise answer if Slovenian authorities would send them the names of doctors allegedly involved in wrongdoings. The prosecutor sent the lawsuit to the National Bureau of Investigation on 12 August 2014 with a request for urgent investigation of this case. The National Bureau of Investigation referred this case to the Organized crime division of the Police Directorate of Ljubljana on 19 August A meeting on this subject took place at the Specialized prosecution Office on 25 \nSeptember 2014. Participants agreed that the police will inquire with assistance of Interpol how the company YY (Slovenian subsidiary of company XX) was selling products in foreign country. It was also agreed that the Specialized Prosecution Office will send a request to competent judicial authorities of the State party of the Convention to gather as much information as possible. On 26 September 2014 and 6 October 2014 state prosecutor sent requests to two prosecutors in the State party to the Convention to ensure that this case would be more proactively investigated. On 10 October 2014 state prosecutor received an answer from the one of them containing contacts of person competent to handle OECD cases. After discussing the fastest possibilities of the MLA procedure the MLA was sent to USA on 5 \nNovember. On 3 October 2014 the Police sent a dispatch via Interpol to the Police of foreign country, requesting information whether they had ever collected information regarding this case. The Police received a reply on 27 October 2014, explaining that police of the foreign county cannot respond to such request, due to lack of information. The next day Slovenian \nPolice sent another dispatch explaining that all available information has been sent and requesting a prompt reply is requested.", "Prosecution service became aware of the possible foreign bribery in this case only during \nPhase 3 evaluation. After receiving this information prosecution service immediately started activities to investigate the allegations. Prosecutor forwarded the case to the police with instructions to check the allegations and collect all evidence which is available. Within the prosecution this case has been allocated to most experienced prosecutors and legal advisers and labeled as matter of \u201cSpecial Significance\u201d. As such, this case is under system of additional quality checks, as described earlier, and is considered a priority case. Currently, police is gathering documentation and is locating persons within Slovenian export credit bank (which made initial allegations in 2009) who would be able to provide any additional information related to these allegations. Prosecutor has set short deadlines to the police and is expecting feedback reports in December the latest. For the time being, due to scarce information available, no need for MLA has yet been detected.", "It should be stressed, however, that the Slovenian export bank was aware of lack of information to support the foreign bribery allegations when passing this to the CPC in 2009. \nAt that time they expressed their awareness that information obtained is insufficient for filling official criminal report. Furthermore, as was noted in the June 2014 Phase 3 OECD WGB Evaluation Report, there was an indictment filed for abuse of position or trust in business in his case.", "Since adoption of the Phase 3 Report, prosecutor of the Specialized State Prosecution Office obtained requested documentation from prosecution authorities in a foreign country. This documentation was forwarded to police for further checking. On 9 September the police, namely National Bureau of Investigation, reported back to Specialized State Prosecution \nOffice (on its request), stating that additional documents obtained from a foreign country confirmed earlier findings of the police (dating into March 2014) that no elements of criminal offence exist in this case. Prosecutor is currently scrutinizing the documentation obtained from Serbia and report of the NBI in order to make the final decision on the case. The decision has not been made yet, but current state of play implies that prosecutor will concur with findings of the police. During these investigations, no suspicions of foreign bribery were detected by Slovenian prosecutor, only suspicions of abuse of authority or trust in business, money laundering and business fraud were detected which failed to materialize, as it seems at this point.", "Additionally to that, in her contacts with prosecutors in foreign country, prosecutor clarified, that no charges for bribery of any kind were in fact brought in the foreign country related to this case. Charges brought in foreign county were against 3 natural persons (including one former minister) and were for abuse of authority, not corruption.", "Generally it could be stated, that activities following the Phase 3 Report did result in better dynamics of the on-going cases and more proactive approach with better use of MLA and guidelines to the police. Office of the Prosecutor General is expecting this would continue to be the case.", "As awareness raising and training is a pre-condition for any kind of detection and an indicator that foreign bribery is an area of priority for law enforcement authorities (goes to points (i) and (iv) of Recommendation 4a), The Office of the State Prosecutor General also pointed out that it is organizing special training on foreign bribery offences for all prosecutors. This training is scheduled for late November and will be held within the central educational event for the prosecutors. Participation of majority of prosecutors is expected. This training will provide prosecutors with insight into particularities of foreign bribery cases and relations this brings to their work. Representatives from the Ministry of Justice and the CPC will be participating at the event on 25.11.2014 and presenting the Anti-bribery convention as well as the results of the monitoring by the OECD WGB, including the latest measures undertaken. Part of the presentation will also include a practical debate via examples of those outstanding normative issues the OECD WGB found in need of further clarification. The result of the training debate will be a relevant indicator as to what kind of clarification means are necessary with respect to issues pointed by the OECD WGB in its latest evaluation (an update on the number of participants will be provided by the time of the December OECD WGB plenary).", "Further to the above, SLO police also provided information that additional training for new employees entering the ranks of criminal investigators (kriminalisti) is planned and will be executed 24.11.2014 by the Criminal police Directorate and the Police Academy. The course \u201cKriminalisti\u010dni te\u010daj 2014\u201d will, according to information received from the police, incorporate information regarding the Convention with an emphasis on specific crimes in the area of foreign bribery. A total of 8 hours of training is planned for this topic. The same course will be repeated in November 2015 (an update on the number of participants in the November 2014 training will be provided by the time of the December OECD WGB plenary). Otherwise, concrete steps taken by the police pertaining to serious investigation of complaints involving foreign bribery (Recommendation 4a (iii)) can be ascertained from the description of the three on-going cases above. In connection to Recommendation 4a (iv) the police reiterated that it has in place a system of processing MLA and foreign operational requests which can result in independent SLO investigations if signs of a crime can be ascertained from the content of the request.", "As was pointed out in the June Phase 3 Report, while not a law enforcement body, the CPC has certain statutory investigative and information-gathering powers (para. 65). It is also responsible for receiving reports of corruption allegations and transmitting such reports to law enforcement authorities (para. 78). In this context CPC\u2019s active participation as a co-beneficiary (together with partners from Denmark and France) in the European Cross-Border Bribery Taskforce (ECBT) led by the City of London Police (OACU)5 and sponsored by the EU is directly relevant in terms of Recommendation 4a (iv) as it is a concrete step towards enhancing working relations with foreign law enforcement authorities, specifically in the area of foreign bribery. CPC participated with its own presentation at the inaugural conference of the ECBT in London (25- 27 June 2014) and has taken charge of one of the deliverables (collection of best and worst cross-border bribery practices) together with our partners from Denmark. As can be read at the project website \u201cThe taskforce is designed to bring together European agencies with similar remits to share information on contemporary practice and case studies, identify mutual cases and opportunities for Joint Investigations, develop networks and build working relationships with anti-bribery professionals and to improve EU-wide knowledge of different agencies\u2019 legal, jurisdictional and operational parameters.\u201d The taskforce is in the process of establishing an online information sharing portal facility and also aims to provide bribery prevention advice to international business community. Other OECD WGB EU countries were encouraged to join at the inaugural meeting.", "Since June CPC has also held several lectures which traditionally include topics on whistleblower protection (e.g on 9.6.2014 the IPCA law (including whistleblower protection) was presented to 38 participants from various parts of the public administration, similarly 25 participants attended the presentation of corruption risks on 19.6.2014, the Supervizor as an analytical application was presented at the Court of Auditors of RS to 86 of its employees, a presentation was organised for the Office for the oversight of the state budget to 39 of its employees and several more similar activities are planned \u2013 all contributing to getting information from diverse sources). Moreover in cooperation with the Administrative Academy specific training on the Anti-bribery convention (also GRECO and UNCAC topics) has been put on the list of standard seminars for public employees, including those working at the MFA. The first seminar is planned to take place by the end of this year. And as was pointed out earlier CPC will also be presenting the Anti-bribery convention at the central training event for prosecutors on 25.11.2014.", "At the end of August and with the aim of facilitating the adoption of the letter to be sent out to \nSlovene diplomatic missions by the MFA, the CPC sent out a letter to four foreign diplomatic missions operating in Slovenia (all countries are members of the OECD WGB) proposing a joint awareness-raising initiative \u201cThis is how we do it\u2026\u201d to collect and share best practices with the final aim of improving information collection from diverse sources at the pre-investigative stage (Recommendation 4a 8 (iv)). Unfortunately none of the four diplomatic missions replied to our initiative so far \u2013 nonetheless with the hope that some OECD WGB member countries who have their diplomatic mission in Slovenia might be interested, the entire initiative letter is reproduced as was sent out in the below section in terms of \u201cfuture situations or policy intentions\u201d.", "If no action has been taken to implement recommendation 4(a), please specify in the space below the measures you intend to take to comply with the recommendation and the timing of such measures or the reasons why no action will be taken:", "In connection to para. 16 of the previous section, the following letter was sent to four foreign diplomatic missions operating in Slovenia. With the hope that some of the OECD WGB member countries might decide to join up, the content of the letter with the proposed initiative is reproduced in its entirety: \u201cPROPOSAL FOR A JOINT AWARENESS RAISING INITIATIVE", "Dear Sirs, \nConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \nTransactions was adopted by the Negotiating Conference in 1997 (Convention). As of May 2014 forty-one countries have ratified the Convention. The Convention has in place a rigorous and evolving mechanism of peer evaluations and a monitoring body \"OECD Working Group on \nBribery in International Transactions\" which is aided by the OECD Secretariat. There have been three rounds of mutual evaluations so far, the discussions on the fourth phase are under way. \nIn 2009 the OECD Council adopted Recommendations for Further Combating Bribery of \nForeign (http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti- bribery/oecdantibriberyrecommendation2009.htm). Among others the Council recommends that \"... each Member country take concrete and meaningful steps in conformity with its jurisdictional and other basic legal principles to examine or further examine the following areas: i) awareness-raising initiatives in the public and private sector for the purpose of preventing and detecting foreign bribery ...\" \nTaking note of the above the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CPC) as the \nSlovenian designated body and coordinator for the Convention proposes a joint awareness- raising initiative \"This is how we do it ...\". The initiative would include bringing together a group of interested diplomatic missions in Slovenia, Slovenian academia, students, companies and business organizations to raise awareness about the Convention and how it is being implemented in practice by various stakeholders. \nThe following is our proposal of the initiative:", "Designating single points of contact (SPOCs) from each interested Embassy which will form the \"Initiative operational body\" (IOB); Making contact with Slovenian academia under the \"Initiative umbrella\" and proposing that they offer their students among others the possibility of choosing a topic covering a specific area of the Convention for their undergraduate/postgraduate thesis (the title/titles either to be agreed upon by the IOB or left to the academia/students or both\u2026); Publicly offering a bursary/grant or reward under the \"Initiative umbrella\" for the best thesis which will be presented at a conference.", "Finding sponsors and reaching out to possible honorary patron(s) (e.g. the President of the \nRepublic, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, OECD Secretary General ... - this could also be an opportunity for a high profile foreign visit/visits to the Republic of Slovenia); Organising and realising the conference; Setting the agenda for a possible repeat of the cycle - with a new topic.", "Possible change - refocusing of topics with greater emphasis on companies operating in \nSlovenia (e.g. their internal compliance mechanisms with regard to the Convention - In 2010 OECD Council adopted \"Good practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics and Compliance (http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/44884389.pdf)).", "What the CPC proposes is that the \u201cfirst cycle\u201d is dedicated to the following topic: \"What is expected/required of diplomatic missions when they receive information that one of the companies incorporated in their home country (or one of their foreign subsidiaries) is involved in corruption abroad?\" \nWe believe this would be an ideal starting topic, as it would give each diplomatic mission that decides to support the initiative the possibility to present its own system in place to combat foreign bribery, present a good/bad case study on the topic and possibly give other member countries an idea on how to improve their own system by utilising good practices. \nShould our idea regarding the cooperation with academia be acceptable, individual SPOCs would be able to facilitate the flow of information (set up interviews, provide documentation) to individual undergraduate/postgraduate students on their own system. \nAt the conference itself each SPOC (or another designated person) could then either on his own or via an individual student focusing on their system present it or present a specific case study. \nThere are various other modalities in which the conference could be organised (e.g. among others, part of the final evaluation/grade for the reward/bursary could be given by conference participants to the final student presenters which make the cut in terms of quality of their dissertations) - but this as well as other ideas presented above should be discussed by the SPOCs at the first IOB meeting of the interested parties. \nPlease consider this note only as a draft idea - if you see potential in the initiative and are interested in participating, send us the contact details of your SPOC and your thoughts on whether or not we should try to bring to the table any other diplomatic missions in Slovenia - no later than 15. September 2014 directly to the e-mail address of our SPOC: [Head of the Slovene OECD WGB delegation]. \nTo conclude our pitch - we believe that not only would this initiative in fact raise awareness of the Convention and possibly improve its implementation, but it could also be presented as a good practice and proof of proactive implementation of the Convention of each participating member state when they have to report to the \"OECD WGB\" on their activities.\u201d", "The initiative will be carried out, if CPC receives at least two other OECD WGB countries with", "Regarding the investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery, the Working Group: c) Recommends that Slovenia, as a matter of urgency, strengthen safeguards and take any other steps to ensure that law enforcement authorities and the CPC are not subject to improper influence by concerns of a political nature or factors prohibited by Article 5 of the Convention in deciding whether to pursue an investigation or prosecution, or transmit corruption allegation reports to law enforcement authorities; [Convention Article 5]", "Action taken as of the date of the follow-up report to implement this recommendation:", "The implementation of Recommendation 4c would be much easier if the OECD WGB were to provide or point to a set of guidelines or a collection of exemplars where it was established in the past by the OECD WGB that a specific decision was \u201cimproperly influenced by concerns of a political nature\u201d or influenced by factors prohibited by Article 5. As it stands now, we can provide the following additional clarifications regarding existing safeguards and some additional measures that were undertaken since June.", "With respect to the independence of the prosecution service in Slovenia, the strongest safeguard on the normative level is the current position of the Constitutional court of RS. In its decision dated 7.2.2013, nb. U-I-42/12-15 our constitutional court had this to say regarding the independence of the prosecution service: \u201cThe State Prosecutor's Office is a system of independent authorities of the state in the framework of which state prosecutors perform, on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 135 of the Constitution, the function of filing and presenting criminal charges as a special function of the state power and other tasks provided by law. With regard to the constitutional content of the function of prosecution, in the framework of which the prosecution of the perpetrators of criminal offences is performed in the name of the state and in the public interest as a repressive operation of the state, the State Prosecutor's Office is a part of the executive branch of power. In the first paragraph of Article 135, the Constitution determines the principle of the functional independence of state prosecutors in the performance of the prosecution function, which also requires the independence of state prosecutor offices as authorities of the state. State prosecutors must be ensured independence when performing their function in concrete cases, because the \nState Prosecutor's Office is not a part of the executive branch of power to the extent that the Government or any ministry could direct political or professional instructions thereto in a concrete case. Therefore, the State Prosecutor's Office, which otherwise is a part of the executive branch of power, entails, as regards the functioning of this power as a whole, a limitation thereof and performs supervision over it, and thereby also importantly co-determines the balance between this power, the legislative power, and especially the judicial power. \nConsequently, state prosecutor offices must be organised as independent authorities of the state. \nThe independence of state prosecutors during the performance of the office of state prosecutor must be ensured by laws that regulate the state prosecution service and the performance of the function of prosecution (e.g. laws that regulate the State Prosecutor's Office, the criminal procedure, and the Police).\u201d6 \nAt the time it was disputed whether it was acceptable or not that the Ministry of Interior performs the administrative tasks related to the organisation and functioning of the State \nProsecutor's Office and supervision over its operations. The question is moot now as these tasks were later conferred back to the Ministry of Justice, but the position of our Constitutional court which said that it does not matter under which ministry the administrative tasks related to the organisation and functioning of the State Prosecutor's Office and supervision over its operations are under as long as/\u201dso lange\u201d this does \u201c\u2026not interfere with the constitutionally determined independence of state prosecutors and state prosecutor offices. Authorisations that would or could reduce the constitutionally required independence of state prosecutors could be constitutionally disputable regardless which ministry and minister is competent for implementing such.\u201d", "In their response to the call for information regarding the written follow-up, The Office of the \nState Prosecutor General pointed out that as was explained during on-site visit and during adoption of the report, Slovene system of prosecution is based on a fundamental principle of independent state prosecutor. This means that state prosecutors, in deciding on individual cases, are bound only by the Constitution and statutes. His/her decision must not be interfered with, not even by their superiors. State prosecutor may therefore not be bound by any instructions on how to resolve a particular matter. Law provides for possibility of issuing general guidelines, but these are general and abstract in nature and must not be related to any particular matter.", "Regarding the improper influence of political nature mentioned in the recommendation it is the understanding of The Office of the State Prosecutor General, that Recommendation 4c is aimed primarily against stopping and preventing improper influences on law enforcement (namely prosecutors). Office of the State Prosecutor General understands this recommendation more as task of other public authorities to ensure an environment for state prosecutors to be able to exercise their competencies without such influences and pressures. As it was already explained, at performing his/her duties prosecutors are bound only to the Constitution and statue. His/her decisions may therefore not be influenced by any political, economic or other interests. \nConsistency of decision making solely on the basis of Constitution and statue is ensured by regular expert inspection of the work of the prosecutors, which takes place at least every three years and every year for newly appointed prosecutors.", "Similarly it is the position of the SLO police that our Criminal procedure Act is the one regulating due process and providing sufficient safeguards. Furthermore Police Tasks and \nPowers Act (Official Gazette of RS, Nb. 15/13) in Art. 5, para.3 specifically states that \u201cA police officer must refuse an order if it is obvious that by executing the order he would be committing a crime. He must immediately communicate the refusal of the order to the internal organizational unit of the police in charge of internal safety or any other competent state body. \nThe police officer who refuses such an order must not be sanctioned in any way\u201d. Similar provisions are included in Art. 5 of the Rules on internal security in the Police (Official Gazette RS, No. 67/14, which came into effect on 4.10.2014). In para. 2 of Art. 5 it is stated that an employee in the police is required to inform his superior of any improper acts. The police also pointed out the Integrity and prevention of corruption act (IPCA), the Code of police ethics and the Code of public servants. They also mentioned their Integrity plan. The latter are governed by \nArt. 47-50 of IPCA and are obligatory among others for all state bodies.", "On 27.10.2014 CPC asked its law enforcement partners to review their Integrity plans specifically regarding how they deal with attempts of improper political influences in the sense of what kind of safeguards they have in place and what actions they prescribe when faced with attempts of improper influences. Moreover CPC itself began a review and possible update of its own Integrity plan.", "The internal CPC procedures regarding the update are still ongoing, however the following general areas requiring safeguards against improper political influences have been identified thus far:", "\uf0b7 prevention of improper influences with the categorisation of cases (i.e. whether a concrete incoming document is classified as a corruption notification or something else (e.g. a general question));", "\uf0b7 prevention of improper influences in the phase of assigning cases to individual corruption", "\uf0b7 prevention of improper influences when deciding on a specific case; \uf0b7 prevention and additional safeguards against leaks of data and information; \uf0b7 prevention of improper influences with potential oversight of circumstances representing a", "\uf0b7 prevention of improper influences amounting to illegal lobbying or illegal influences with", "respect to CPC opinions to draft legislation.", "(an update on the formal stage of the review will be provided by the time of the December OECD WGB plenary).", "It needs to be added that CPC already has in place Rules of Procedure of the Commission for the \nPrevention of Corruption (Official Gazette RS, No. 24/12) where handling of notifications regarding IPCA violations is prescribed. Any final upgrade to CPC\u2019s Integrity plan will thus only be an enhancement to relatively strong safeguards against improper influences that are already in place. To substantiate what was said -generally the process in the Investigation and \nOversight Bureau is as follows: in the preliminary/screening phase the officer assigned a case does the initial screening of the notification and proposes whether or not to start a CPC investigation, close the file and/or transmit the allegations to other state bodies including the police. His/her reasoned decision is electronically sent to verification to his/her superior. If it is decided that the case will be looked into in more detail and has passed the preliminary screening process, a plan of action is proposed to the CPC senate together with a specific priority level of the case file. Following that a case cannot be closed without a decision of the CPC senate. \nOfficers that are assigned a case are independent in their collection of documentation and data and they provide their own independent and reasoned proposal for the conclusion of the case to the CPC senate which makes the final decision on the case. The entire documentation flow (including any reassignment of a case file) is recorded in the electronic case management system from the point of entry (when the first notification is received by the CPC) to the final decision, including any drafts that were rejected and/or asked to be corrected (each entry/correction in the electronic case management system is recorded). In the end phase, two out of three votes by the three member CPC senate are required to accept the decision.", "To strengthen its independence, IPCA provides a special procedure for appointment and dismissal of the CPC senate. Chief Commissioner and two deputies are appointed by the \nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia following an open recruitment procedure and nomination by a special selection board. Candidates which must meet high professional and integrity standards are interviewed and screened by a selection board comprising a representative of the \nGovernment, the National Assembly, non-governmental organisations, the Independent Judicial \nCouncil and the Independent Council of Officials. The Chief Commissioners' term of office is six years, the deputies' five. They can serve up to two terms in office.
