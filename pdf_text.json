{"Text": ["Public sector organisations have always looked for new ways to fulfil their public mission. The \nNew Deal in the United States, the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, the development of the welfare state, experiments in New Public Management, the rise of e-government have all been phases of great change in public administrations, when governments experimented with new ideas, policies, processes, institutional arrangements, management tools and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Each of the above examples can be broken apart to expose a great number of innovations undertaken by public organisations which inspired similar innovations across OECD countries.", "And today is no different. Recent studies indicate significantly high overall rates of innovation in public sector organisations. The European Union\u2019s (EU) Innobarometer 2010 found that across the EU27, 66 per cent of organisations on average report having implemented a service innovation. Local \nGovernment Authorities and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom surveyed for Nesta\u2019s 2011 pilot survey reported having implemented very high levels of innovation, with over 90 per cent of organisations reporting a service, process or management technique for innovation.2", "Developing a better understanding of how innovation happens in governments appears to be gaining increased traction among policy makers and researchers alike. This trend reflects the recognition that some of the traditional approaches to addressing public policy challenges may not provide solutions to the complex challenges that governments face today. \u201cWicked\u201d problems, such as climate change, poverty, HIV, and population ageing require new and different perspectives often working together. The development of new sets of organisational forms, governance structures, funding mechanisms, policy approaches, partnerships and accountability structures blur traditional distinctions between public and private to look for novel solutions to address some of the world\u2019s most difficult problems. At the same time, technological progress is advancing at a speed never seen before, opening great opportunities for governments to incorporate new tools and approaches, while placing great pressure on governments to keep pace.", "The nature of public sector problems - complex, cross-boundary and unsolvable by traditional government tools and approaches \u2013 also reinforce the importance of building the capacity of government to innovate and invent solutions to the complex and intractable problems faced by society. Problem complexity is mirrored by increasingly complex, pluralistic and interconnected communities and societies. \nIncreases in migration and social inequality develop complex landscapes within which to navigate.", "Furthermore, many governments are recovering from the economic and fiscal shock precipitated by the 2008 financial crisis and therefore find themselves in a double bind: while many of their services are needed by citizens impacted by the crisis, governments\u2019 capacity to deliver these same services are increasingly compromised by tight fiscal conditions.", "This was the backdrop for the 2010 Ministerial Meeting in Venice where OECD ministers acknowledged the importance of fostering efficiency and effectiveness through innovation in the public sector. They challenged the OECD to assess the main current and future challenges and constraints facing governments and to propose innovative approaches for building a more efficient, effective and well- performing public sector by drawing lessons from country experience and developing policy guidance.", "The confluence of these factors is creating space for a new horizon in public policy making to emerge. One that draws on the lessons of the past, what worked and what did not, and complements this with new tools that are more open, collaborative, iterative and participatory.", "To support governments in meeting these challenges but also to make the most of the new opportunities that they represent, the OECD under the guidance of the OECD Public Governance \nCommittee, has developed the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI). The Observatory\u2019s mission is to support governments in using innovation to transform their public sector by developing a deeper understanding of public sector innovation, building an evidence base of what works and connecting innovators in the public sector around the world to share their experience and learn from each other. (Box 1).", "This report is provided as a background document for discussion at the OECD Conference \u201cInnovating the Public Sector: from Ideas to Impact\u201d (12-13 November 2014) and provides a synthesis of initial findings of the Observatory work. It aims to explore this new junction in public policy making, drawing on lessons from the past and evidence of how governments are innovating today to present the framework for a systematic analysis of public sector innovation. This report draws on work previously conducted by the OECD on public sector modernisation and reforms to suggest that a unique public sector innovation paradigm is emerging and providing a key for its understanding and further analysis.", "From an analytical perspective, the report suggests that an innovation lens can help to identify the capability and capacity of public sector organisations. Building on collected evidence and theory the report begins to ask questions about how the elements of organisational structure, process, culture, and technology interact to support or impede the individuals and teams who drive innovation in the public sector. Drawing these elements together, it develops a framework for public sector innovation capacity building. This provides the basis for the identification and structuring of key questions to define a larger research agenda for the OECD in this area. The framework and its key components are presented in the next chapters.", "There is not an established definition of innovation in the public sector however some common elements have merged from national and international research projects. While public sector innovation has not been well researched, much can be learned from the more established work studying innovation in the private sector. The Oslo Manuel (2005) defines innovation in firms as:", "The implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, a new marketing", "method, or a new organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations.", "Two important characteristics of innovation are highlighted in this definition. Firstly, an innovation must be implemented, meaning that it cannot just be a good idea but rather must have been put in place operationally. \nSecondly, an innovation must be novel, either by being entirely new or a significant improvement. Novelty is subjective so that an innovation must be new for the organisation where it is implemented, but may already be in use elsewhere.", "As noted above, one of the key differences between the public and private sectors is that of objectives. \nInnovation offers companies a means to achieve competitive advantage in the market to support profit generation. In contrast, there is no single bottom line motivating public sector organisations to innovate. Objectives in the public sector are multiple and competing and often requires striking a balance between competing values. Altruistic motivation (e.g. to support one's community or the values of an organisation) also play an important driver of public sector innovation.", "Nevertheless, impact should not be ignored when referring to innovation in the public sector. Innovation should not just be about implementing something new, but also achieving results of value for society. As one simple definition of public sector innovation captures it: \u2018public sector innovation is about new ideas that work at creating public value\u2019. \nEach public innovation is aimed at addressing a public policy challenge and a successful public innovation is one that achieves the desired public outcome (a political judgement reflected in government decisions).", "Building on these elements and evidence of innovations in the public sector, the OECD Observatory has identified the following characteristics of public sector innovation:", "Novelty: innovations introduce new approaches, relative to the context where they are introduced", "Implementation: innovations must be implemented, not just an idea", "Impact: innovations aim to result in better public results including efficiency, effectiveness, and user or employee", "These are seen to be the emerging principles of public sector innovation, based on the OPSI\u2019s current knowledge.

These changes are being driven by different forces, including a more globalised and networked world, rising citizen expectations, new technologies, increasingly complex problems facing governments and \u2013 particularly since the 2008 economic crisis \u2013 tight budgets. Whatever the reason, the consensus seems clear: public sector organisations need new ways of working.", "OECD framework for analysing public sector innovation", "Drawing on recent experiences in national and sub-national governments, as well as lessons from the past, the OECD has developed a framework for analysing public sector innovation. This framework looks at the organisational factors that can encourage \u2013 or hinder \u2013 innovation. First, it identifies four levels that must be considered when addressing innovation: 1) the individual innovator, 2) the organisation in which he or she operates, 3) the public sector as a whole and 4) society. The organisational factors affecting these different levels are then grouped under four themes: knowledge and learning, organisational culture, rules and processes, and organisational design. Both the levels and factors are interlinked, and the borders between them are not always clear-cut. It is important to look at them as an integrated system. This framework can guide future research, and forms the basis for the OECD \u201cInnovation Imperative: A Call to \nAction\u201d.", "Generating and sharing ideas", "The flow of information is essential for generating new ideas, and how data and knowledge are managed and shared within an organisation can support or inhibit innovation. Public sector organisations need systems to gather and manage information produced both internally and externally, including data on their own finances and overall performance, individuals\u2019 knowledge and ideas, information on the needs and demands of users, ideas from outside their organisations, etc. Increasingly, governments are using social media and crowdsourcing to interact with the public more directly, and actively seek citizens\u2019 input on how to improve public services.", "It is not enough just to gather data, however; organisations must also be able to use that information to make changes \u2013 to become learning organisations. Knowledge management can help, but it is important that the organisational culture supports continuous learning. It is also crucial to share information to increase its innovative potential, and to help spread ideas and promising practices across organisations. \nOpen Government Data and \u201cbig data\u201d initiatives offer both new sources of public sector information and new ways to share it with people and firms outside of the public sector, who may, in turn, use it to come up with new ideas, services or products.", "Empowering the workforce to innovate", "The cultural dimension of the framework looks at how to motivate and encourage people to innovate. \nWhile pay does not seem to be an important motivator of innovation in the public sector, other extrinsic rewards such as recognition, career advancement, special assignments and competitions may play a role.", "Intrinsic factors such as seeing the value and impact of one\u2019s work, and learning new skills, can also be a strong incentive. Human resources management practices that integrate such motivating factors can help create an environment that encourages innovation. However, the informal incentives embedded in an organisation\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d may be even more important, including relationships within hierarchies, the approach to teamwork, and the tolerance of experimentation and failure. Traditionally, the public sector tends to be averse to risk, but being innovative implies a certain amount of trial and error. Leaders and supervisors set the tone, and their support for and commitment to innovation is crucial.", "Adapting rules and processes to foster innovation", "The complex set of laws, rules and procedures that govern the public sector may have unintended effects that hinder innovation. Just as they have simplified administrative processes for businesses, governments may want to examine regulations inside government to eliminate overlapping and contradictory rules, to clarify acceptable practices, and to ensure that legislation does not needlessly limit or discourage potential innovation.", "Similarly, policies governing how financial and human resources are allocated can make it difficult or costly for an organisation to invest in innovation or share resources with others to achieve common objectives. Some fiscal consolidation measures may also reduce the capacity to innovate, even as countries seek ways to improve productivity and efficiency. Allowing ministries or agencies a certain level of resource flexibility is one way for government to support innovation.", "Countries are exploring new approaches to project management that involve citizens, users and staff in decision making. These new approaches focus on the desired outcome and then adapt processes to achieve it, rather than building a service around existing organisational structures. They rely on collaboration across organisations and sectors, and often use pilot testing, experimental design and prototyping. While these approaches minimise risk by allowing innovations to be adjusted before being implemented on a large scale, they do require a greater degree of flexibility than many public organisations are accustomed to.", "Reviewing organisational design", "Governments today face problems that are increasingly complex, multi-dimensional and interrelated. \nTo tackle challenges such as energy sustainability or youth unemployment, they must draw on the expertise and resources of a broad range of people and organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors and academia. Identifying these different sources of knowledge and finding ways for them to collaborate means rethinking how organisations are designed and how work is managed. To encourage networks and collaborative working, countries are experimenting with flexibility staffing systems that allow people to be moved to specific projects, and with new leadership responsibilities that cut across different policy domains.", "Such flexibility and collaboration can be difficult to achieve, especially within traditional organisational structures and human resource management frameworks. Clear communications, prior agreements (including on financial arrangements) and representative steering committees can make different parties more willing to work together. Governments are also finding new ways to work with citizens, the private sector and civil society to \u201cco-design\u201d public services. Innovation labs to tackle specific problems, social impact bonds to fund new services, and \u201ccollaborative commissioning\u201d to co- design service contracts are some examples of these new partnership approaches.", "Finally, to truly transform public services, it is also important to stop providing services that are not effective, difficult as that may be, to free up resources to develop new, more effective ones.", "8", "Donner aux effectifs des moyens d'innover", "Dans sa dimension culturelle, le cadre cherche des moyens d'encourager les personnes \u00e0 innover.

The framework is not meant to be normative \u2013 it does not offer an ideal to strive towards. Nor is it empirical, based on proven science or theory.

These ideas are inspired by the needs of citizens and are transformed from idea to practice through the commitment of public servants and leaders who anticipate these needs and respond to them.

These can include extrinsic factors such as the way that pay is structured and the way promotions are granted.

Engagement is often defined in conjunction with motivation, commitment and job satisfaction, and is significantly correlated in multiple studies to improved organisational outcomes including performance and innovation. For example, studies by Gallup on firms in the private sector found that firms with low staff engagement experience significantly higher staff turnover and more accidents. Conversely, those with higher engagement have more customer advocacy, higher productivity, and more profit.15 These findings have been corroborated by other researchers. Furthermore, engagement correlates with innovation \u2013 fifty nine per cent of engaged employees say that their job brings out their most creative ideas, compared with only three percent of disengaged employees.16", "Motivated employees are hence considered to be better at their job, to put in more effort to achieve outcomes, and to be willing to push for positive change in their workplaces by committing extra energy above and beyond the minimum required from their job descriptions.", "Motivation is also considered to be deeply personal \u2013 what motivates one person may discourage another, and this adds to its complexity and mystery. At the most basic level, people are motivated to do things that they perceive to produce a beneficial outcome. At the individual level, it\u2019s common to distinguish between two kinds of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation compels people to act for a reward that is gained by the activity itself. Frey and Osterloh (2002) identify three kinds of intrinsic motivation: in the first form, people do an activity because it brings them pleasure. In the second, it\u2019s the completion of the activity that brings them pleasure (e.g. crossing the finish line of a marathon, meeting an important deadline). The third is motivation to comply with internally held standards. This last category includes values-based standards, such as community service, commitment to family, ethical fairness, etc. \nExtrinsic motivation compels people to act for a reward that is separated from the act itself. The most common example is financial payment for services rendered.", "Many central governments face significant challenges in motivating innovative behaviour from their employees. Some of these challenges are rooted in the bureaucratic nature of public sector organisations. For example, multiple levels of hierarchy often separate staff from the decision-making level, and the administrative nature of many of the jobs can result in a feeling of removal from the impact of their work. Some of these challenges result from the public and political nature of the work.

From the bottom-up one could identify ways to encourage employees to experiment with new approaches, to explore new avenues, and to celebrate this kind of behaviour to inspire others to act in similar ways.", "Human Resource Management (HRM) policies are one set of organisational levers that affect the behaviour of professional public servants.

The theory of Public \nService Motivation17 suggests that many public sector employees pursue their careers because they are intrinsically motivated to create public value rather than increasing private wealth. If this is true, then these employees will be intrinsically motivated by seeing the positive benefits of their efforts. It follows, then, that if staff are motivated by the impact of their work, they will also be motivated to innovate when ideas and opportunities come together to increase the impact that their efforts produce.", "Understanding and leveraging this kind of motivation implies HRM practices which are designed to bring employees closer to the impact of their work, structure learning opportunities by interacting with their beneficiaries and others who share similar values and take pride in similar kinds of work (Box 5).

Either by leveraging existing technology platforms, re-using public properties for new purposes, or by re-allocating staff, Ministries were able to reduce costs of an innovation, while ensuring that existing investments and resources were used to maximum effect. In this way, rules that allow for a certain level of resource flexibility appear to enable public sector innovation.", "Budgeting rules may also impact the incentives for organisations to innovate. For example, some organisations are able to harvest savings to fund other priorities, whereas others are expected to return savings to the central budget authority and may even have their subsequent years\u2019 budgets reduced. In the former case, the organisation can reap benefits from efficiency-producing innovation and may be incentivised to do so. In the latter case, there may be a disincentive to introduce innovations that result in cost savings and/or that require longer-term investments. Organisations may try to hide innovative practices from their Central Budget Authorities in order to not lose savings to fiscal consolidation. In doing so, they may limit the effectiveness, spread and application of innovative practices.", "Many OECD countries have recently faced periods of deficit and fiscal consolidation as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. This context gave extra weight to the innovation imperative and governments struggled to consider how best to spur innovation while, at the same time, reducing their overall government expenditures. It can be assumed that different approaches to fiscal consolidation would have different impacts on an organisation\u2019s innovative capacity, both in terms of the incentives to innovate, as well as their ability to fund it. For example, many organisations experience a tightening of their fiscal rules regarding their ability to reallocate resources. Unpredictable fiscal consolidation measures, especially when accompanied by lack of budget flexibility, can lead to cuts that reduce strategic capacity and lead to short-term thinking.", "One challenge for governments facing fiscal consolidation is how best to reduce spending while enhancing and preserving the capacity required to innovate, and even to use certain budget cutting exercises as a way to accelerate innovation in government. However, if all resources are being used to meet day-to-day operational needs, there are no resources or capabilities left to innovate. Tools such as automatic productivity cuts, strategic expenditure reviews, and funding freezes have been used in various combinations in many countries, and each will impact the capacity of government to innovate in the future. \nHow these tools impact innovation, and what combination is optimal under which conditions is an area that requires further research.

An integrated design of all involved organizational dimensions is needed: access to the service, use of technology, internal organization, work processes (service, support, coordination), systems of coordination and control (planning, hierarchical control, leadership, etc.), microstructures (working groups, including substitutes, offices, clerks, etc.), roles (Judges, Clerks, etc.), people management systems (remuneration, etc.), control systems (leadership, professional communities, cultures etc.).

Start with standardising the processes. Involve line management with standardised decisions. Big complexity needs a step by step development and implementation (no big bangs).

Take care of real commitment at the TOP. Keep Track! And move with the winds where necessary. Take real cooperation as a key-way of working with all the parties involved.", "An important element of this innovation management approach is that ideas are put into practice either hypothetically or in small and controlled areas to collect evidence of its effectiveness before being expanded to a wider impact area. Starting small, and strategically growing enables managers to get a good sense of the impact innovations will have when implemented on a larger scale, and gives ample opportunities to adjust and adapt quickly based on reactions from users. In this scenario, piloting, prototyping and other experimental design tools can be used to implement new approaches safely and minimise the risk associated with innovation. Failures, when they happen, happen early before large amounts of resources are invested, and act as a learning experience and a step towards eventual success.", "Prototyping involves the quick production of samples that can be tested by their end-users to determine effective fit. Once a prototype appears appropriate, it can be put into the field in a pilot study to determine whether an innovation will have intended impacts and other consequences. Using tools such as developmental evaluation, the pilot can be continually assessed and adjusted based on a real-time flow of information. Such an approach requires clarity of desired outcomes, but also flexibility to identify and capture unanticipated benefits as they appear during the piloting process. It also requires evaluation tools and capabilities, indicators for monitoring, and the time and resources to ensure that evaluation (and resulting adjustments) is built into the implementation process.", "These approaches enable continuous learning and allow ideas to be developed and re-developed to ensure good fits \u2013 they collapse the traditional design-implement-evaluate stages into one continuous learning experiment. This, ideally, reduces uncertainty and risk associated with a larger \u201cbig-bang\u201d style implementation, by recognising that complex projects in complex environments will produce unexpected impacts and being ready to respond and adapt on the fly.", "However, such approaches depend on a greater degree of organisational flexibility than many public organisations are comfortable with. Furthermore, by providing an opportunity to engage with end users early and often throughout the process, they can open up new opportunities for innovation and can inspire new solutions to problems that may have been previously overlooked. For this reason, these methods align well with the use of new organisational models discussed in the next section, and the open data tools discussed in the first section. Finally, it\u2019s been pointed out that taking such steps requires an empowered and skilled workforce and a culture shift within organisations (see section 2) \u2013 and a shift from the mind-set of \u2018expert\u2019, to that of a learner.", "Box 7. Pilot testing, experimental design, prototyping: insights from the OPSI database", "Pilot testing has been long used in the public sector and has been mentioned by a great number of the cases collected in the OPSI.

As the Spanish experience suggests, pilots work best when coupled with a continuous assessment of impacts and the ability to adjust and correct on the fly. This can also be applied to the broader roll-out process, as a policy is taken from the smaller controlled environment to the wider complex world. This requires quite a different approach, sometimes referred to as \u201cexperimental policy design\u201d (Eppel et al, 2011)24. This approach to policy development is alluded to in the United States\u2019 discussion of learning and growth:", "The innovation is in a constant state of testing and analysis.

Once solutions are deployed, they are carefully monitored and readjusted on a continuous basis. Having proved successful, the methodology is now being extended to another 50 hospitals across the country. What is interesting here is that it is not the results of the pilot that are being replicated, but the process. Each hospital may end up implementing very different reforms as a result of their own innovation journey, depending on their unique contexts. This is fundamental to the concept of innovation.", "The Canadian open policy approach also uses a very experimental approach to its innovation \u2013 with a focus on", "continuous revision and tweaking as a key element of its policy design:", "The framework underwent continuous revisions and prototyping over subsequent months and years as best practices emerged and experience grew.

Allies are important at all levels, including senior management. Visibility is important to inspire early adopters. Quick wins are important (i.e. the philosophy was sound but the Policy Planning Bureau needed to show the proof). While some of open policy pilot projects may fail, they are designed to encourage a culture of experimentation. Experimentation is about finding out what works and what does not work in order to discover what works best. It entails taking smart risks. Eureka moments are the result of countless experiments that yielded more lessons than results. In order to mitigate the innovation-dampening effects of a risk-averse culture open policy seeks to emphasise the importance of experimentation and learning rather than failing.", "Prototyping is another tool that fits nicely within the overall context of an experimental approach to innovation. This approach develops, tests and improves ideas within a simulated environment, with the participation of all relevant people at an early stage in the process. It allows problem solvers to move from intangible ideas to concrete solutions early, before all the issues are identified and worked out.

Given that rules are put in place for a reason, simplifying or eliminating them will mean addressing alternative approaches to ensure the desired behaviour: this raises questions of instrument choice, managerial and performance systems, cultural and ethical norms, and strategic and learning capacity and flexibility.", "Research may wish to look at the way that different organisations review their internal rules and regulations, and whether the same approaches to red tape burden reduction applied to external policies can apply internally.", "Budgeting practices and their impact on innovation lead to a great variety of study directions. \nOne could be on funding mechanisms for innovation in government \u2013 whether they exist, how best to develop them, how to calibrate to organisational priorities, etc. Another area for exploration could relate to the flexibility of overall funding arrangements that enable organisations to reallocate resources to innovate while still ensuring appropriate control and stewardship of public finances. A third direction for research could be on the use of fiscal restraint mechanisms and their link to innovation. How can organisations be encouraged to innovate in times of tight fiscal restraint?", "Finally, the impact of reducing regulations has implications for the workforce discussed in the previous sections. More evaluation and monitoring will mean the need for stronger analytical capacity. \nAdditionally, moving from a highly regulated to a more innovative workplace might require more skilled staff which may require new skill sets and investments for a higher performing public service.", "SECTION 4: TACKLING COMPLEXITY", "The increasingly complex, interrelated and multi-dimensional nature of problems faced by governments today are leading many to ask which governance models are best suited to address them25. \nIssues such as unemployment, population ageing, and energy sustainability touch on the expertise, knowledge and resources of numerous individuals and organisations, which span the public, private and civil society sectors. The relevance of these different organisations means that there are different \u2018routes for public innovation\u2019 to bring together the contribution of governments, businesses, academia and civil society.26 Developing innovative capacity may depend on and the ability of government to steer a vast ecosystem of relationships across sectors to that enable society\u2019s resources to be best channelled to target need.", "Organisational design looks at the work that needs to be achieved, how its component parts can be divided, how these parts connect and how organisational activities will be managed.27 Moving to a government context this means taking an issue such as youth unemployment; thinking about the components that shape it such as economic growth, labour market policies, and education; thinking about where the knowledge, resources and execution of these components lie, for example, policy making in different line ministries, policy execution in schools, universities and businesses, expert knowledge from academic experts; considering how work can be managed so that the resources of each actor are channelled effectively to provide a joined-up solution; and establishing an organisational design that supports this. \nOrganisational design therefore has implications for how individuals, organisations, the public administration as a whole, and society in general interact and work together.", "Rethinking some elements of organisational, system-wide and institutional designs may offer one lever to improve collaboration within and across entities. The public sector is often charged with having a weak capacity for integrated, collaborative ways of working. There is \u2018silo\u2019 working both within and across organisations, with managers arguably devoting more energy to defending their own fiefdoms than working corporately. At the same time, an inward focus can lead to policy conversations being limited to government. Rethinking organisational design, from the individual jobs, teams and upward, could be one effective approach to overcoming some of these tendencies, and better support the kinds of information and data sharing discussed in the first section of this paper.", "It must of course be acknowledged that the size and constitutional arrangements of a country influence the amount and formality of the co-ordination required in that given context. In small states for example, much of the horizontal co-ordination may take place informally. However as the size of the state grows, and with it the diversity of society, the more explicit structures become necessary to ensure an inclusive approach and that certain groups are not left out.", "Looking beyond public organisations to enhance innovative capacities", "Individuals and organisations working in isolation cannot achieve the level of change that the public service requires. The capacity of civil servants to deal with the complexity of today\u2019s issues depend on their ability to act as \u201cstewards\u201d who need to understand the interactions and connections of different organisations and actors across the delivery landscape.28 To achieve this, individual civil servants require \u2018linking capacity\u2019 to other organisations at policy, professional and user levels.29 Such networks make the valuable insights, resources and capacity of these different agents accessible to individual staff and the organisations where they work, as well as providing motivational aspects that can address some of the issues discussed in section 2.", "How far individuals and organisations connect with each other and work collaboratively is affected by formal structures such as how teams are designed, how work is organised, the management of information and performance incentives that recognise sharing and collaboration. Informal features such as culture and networks and leadership support are equally important in shaping the extent of individual collaboration and its quality.", "The formal design of teams may affect how far individuals collaborate with actors with different backgrounds and sets of skills. In the United Kingdom, a new trend among line ministries is to use more flexible pools of staff that can either be moved across a whole department or directorate to staff specific projects, or small flexible pools of staff are deployed to urgent or priority work as it emerges30.", "Such flexible staffing systems may facilitate the development of networks and collaboration because individuals are constantly required to work with new sets of individuals, each with a different skills set and background. In contrast to standing policy teams, such flexible working may result in greater exposure to different issues, and therefore different organisations and people, supporting the development of individuals\u2019 networks.", "Other approaches to organisational structure include altering the responsibility of senior leaders. \nTraditional hierarchical structures with individual leaders heading up different discreet policy domains with standing teams beneath them may encourage silo working where each team and senior leader focus on their own policy domain to the neglect of the wider picture. Instead, giving primary responsibility for policy to a single senior leader across a number of different domains in an unstructured team setting may encourage more strategic, collaborative working across a whole ministry or group of related ministries.31", "There are also challenges associated with such ways of working. More flexible structures may make it difficult to develop strong relationships with stakeholders, and may reduce the corporate memory and deeper policy knowledge related to specific fields. Knowledge management systems must work well to ensure that knowledge is retained and supports continuous improvement, even if some individuals move to different projects.", "Equally, it should be acknowledged that organisational autonomy and human resources frameworks can make such a flexible vision difficult to achieve in reality. Different posts and functions are associated with correspondingly different wage scales and benefits meaning that simply shifting staff to different teams and different job profiles is procedurally and practically difficult.", "Developing innovative, joined up public policies that draw on the resources of all relevant actors requires effective collaboration across the whole of government. The innovations collected by the OPSI frequently emphasise the importance of different structures and approaches for effective cross-government working to facilitate the success of innovations.", "A number of innovations highlighted the role of multiple organisations from across the public sector in providing knowledge and experiences to support their development. For example, Open Policy \nDevelopment in Canada necessitated collaborative working with other parts of the administration:", "Open Policy Development in Canada", "One challenge is that policy staffs are not strictly operational in their focus. Other divisions have more immediate responsibilities and interactions with external clients. This has meant that developing pilot projects and other applications of open policy development has required partnering with service-delivery divisions.", "However, innovation cases collected through the OPSI suggest that establishing such collaboration is not always easy. Challenges included identifying leadership and authority when a project engages multiple actors from different organisations and levels of government. This was a challenge highlighted by Germany when developing its unified public service number, 115. As a multilevel project with independent actors and without a centralised authority, coming to a mutual understanding on the organisational, technical, legal and financial aspects of the implementation was difficult.", "Another challenge highlighted by OPSI cases is that different organisations may be reluctant to collaborate.

It was not easy to bring all the pertinent agencies together and coordinate them to work together. To tackle these issues, we organised conferences and workshops for those in charge at public agencies to emphasise the importance of online delivery.", "Innovations noted that specific infrastructures, in particular steering committees and prior agreements helped to facilitate cross-government, and even cross-sector working.

The financing arrangement was reflected in the project\u2019s steering committee, which was composed of representatives from national, regional, and local government.", "The experiences of the innovations collected by the OPSI indicate that developing structures and frameworks that support collaboration across government is not only important in terms of helping to generate innovative ideas, but in providing the guidance and resources to support an innovative idea to its fruition.", "Partnering beyond public entities: co-designing and co-producing public services", "In the context of contemporary \u2018wicked\u2019 problems, collaboration beyond government with society is perhaps more important than ever. Citizens interact with public services in a variety of ways whether in relation to their health, their family, their employment, their education and their income to name a few. Furthermore, issues such as population ageing or inequality are not the domain of any single organisation but touch different bodies across different parts of the public, private and civil society sectors. \nIf public organisations and public institutions are going to have the capacity to develop innovative solutions that tackle these issues they need to be able to collaborate and partner effectively with actors from across society.", "Some countries are experimenting with new structures and units that facilitate the public sector\u2019s ability to engage the broad range of actors who are relevant to any single issue. Many of these units apply design concepts to public services which involve bringing together interested actors to co-design creative solutions. In Finland, the Cardboard Hospital brought together staff, patients and experts to design a better hospital environment for its users.", "There are efforts to institutionalise this co-design approach in some countries and cities, through the creation of innovation labs, such as Mindlab in Denmark, the pilot of the Helsinki Design Lab in \nFinland, the newly created Policy Lab in the United Kingdom, and the offices of New Urban Mechanics in \nBoston and Philadelphia (see box).

They may be a place where staff can come together to learn about human-centered design or to address large scale policy problems.

This is predicated not just on the fact that the public sector does not have all the tools to generate the desired public outcomes or to address some of the complex issues we are facing as a society. Public results require the active contribution of multiple actors in society. While efforts in the 1990s to introduce the private sector to the public service delivery landscape were met with mixed success, the OPSI cases highlight that governments today are going beyond public-private partnerships by collaborating with a wider range of partners. Their motivations reflect that in some cases, organisations from civil society may be better placed in terms of local knowledge and specialisation to deliver services. This reflects that fundamentally partnerships should be based on the relative strengths of a particular partner (rather than any specific ideology). In some cases smaller, local charities or organisations with a history of delivering services to a specific community maybe better placed to identify how to meet their needs than a national (or multinational) provider acting on a larger scale and perhaps apparently with greater resources at its disposal.", "However traditional forms of contracting and commissioning may make it difficult for civil society organisations to engage in public service delivery. Smaller voluntary organisations may lack the skills and capacity to respond successfully to tender bids while performance-based payment regimes may entail non- or partial-payment risks which are too high for such organisations to bear. If public sector organisations want to be able to tap into the knowledge, experience and networks of civil society bodies they need to consider how they can engage with them and what tools they can use to overcome these challenges so that these issues do not become a barrier for partnering with them.", "The collected OPSI cases highlight a number of innovative funding mechanisms that some countries are experimenting with to support service delivery through and with civil society organisations. \nThrough innovative approaches to social investment, such as social impact bonds, investors\u2019 capital is supporting civil society providers to deliver services, while the government pays the investors on a payment by results model.

Going further, \u2018co-producing commissioning\u2019 establishes a dialogue with providers and stakeholders to agree on objectives, processes and resources.32", "Collaborative commissioning is also about going beyond the competition dynamic. Clearly competition has a role to play through market testing and contestability to drive both internal and external actors to improve performance, however if it is the only or predominant dynamic this may ultimately undermine service quality. In the context of complex, multifaceted issues such as long term health or social care service providers should be encouraged to share information on cases and performance, and given they have direct knowledge of service users and their needs, they should also feel comfortable to suggest new approaches which may help to support more innovative procurement. In commissioning partnerships characterised by competition, providers may be discouraged to do either of these things.33", "Being innovative does not necessarily mean expanding existing service provision. Once innovations are proven to work, they need to replace the existing status quo.

Increasingly, policy making and service delivery involves a number of actors with varied interests, values and demands and who play roles that in the past only governments played.

The changing composition of society is further amplifying citizens\u2019 expectations and service demands with calls for more responsive and more customised services intensifying as a result. Citizens also expect their governments to live within their means, to be increasingly open and transparent, and to make available relevant information.", "Governments cannot meet these expectations by doing less, but most governments can no longer afford to do more of the same. More importantly, they are discovering that many traditional prescriptions have not been sufficient or effective, and that new, more agile and innovative solutions are needed.

Such efforts should ensure that the accountability regime is both robust and easy to navigate while also more systematically focused on enabling innovation. New outcome-focused approaches to project management are one step in moving away from the rigidities of a command-and-control model."], "Summary": ["GOV/PGC(2014)25", "R\u00c9SUM\u00c94", "Les institutions sont en qu\u00eate d'innovation, dans leurs m\u00e9thodes de travail, la nature et les modalit\u00e9s de prestation des services publics et les modes d\u2019interaction avec les citoyens, les entreprises et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile. Cette volont\u00e9 de changement est motiv\u00e9e par plusieurs forces : un monde plus global et connect\u00e9 en r\u00e9seau, des citoyens plus exigeants, l\u2019apparition de nouvelles technologies et une complexit\u00e9 croissante des d\u00e9fis auxquels doivent faire face les gouvernements, notamment les restrictions budg\u00e9taires, accentu\u00e9es par la crise \u00e9conomique de 2008. Quoi qu'il en soit, le consensus est clair : il est n\u00e9cessaire d'instaurer de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de travailler dans le secteur public.", "Cadre OCDE pour l\u2019analyse de l\u2019innovation dans le secteur public", "L'OCDE s'est inspir\u00e9 de r\u00e9centes exp\u00e9riences \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale et au niveau infranational, tout en tirant parti des le\u00e7ons du pass\u00e9, pour d\u00e9velopper un cadre d'analyse concernant l'innovation dans le secteur public. Ce cadre se penche sur les facteurs structurels susceptibles d'encourager ou de freiner l'innovation. \nEn premier lieu, quatre niveaux d'intervention sont identifi\u00e9s : la personne innovante ; la structure dans laquelle celle-ci \u00e9volue ; le secteur public dans son ensemble ; et enfin la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les facteurs structurels jouant sur ces diff\u00e9rents niveaux d\u2019intervention sont ensuite regroup\u00e9s en quatre blocs : connaissance et savoir, culture interne \u00e0 l'organisation, r\u00e8gles et proc\u00e9dures et sch\u00e9ma d\u2019organisation. Il n'est pas toujours facile de faire la distinction entre ces niveaux et ces facteurs, qui entretiennent des liens \u00e9troits. Il convient de les aborder comme un syst\u00e8me int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Un tel cadre peut s'av\u00e9rer utile pour orienter de futures recherches. C'est sur lui que repose \u00ab L'imp\u00e9ratif de l'innovation: Un appel \u00e0 l'action\u00bb de l'OCDE.", "G\u00e9n\u00e9rer des id\u00e9es et les diffuser", "La circulation des informations est essentielle pour faire surgir de nouvelles id\u00e9es. La fa\u00e7on dont les donn\u00e9es et le savoir sont administr\u00e9s et diffus\u00e9s au sein d'une structure peut encourager l'innovation, ou au contraire l'entraver. Les administrations publiques doivent se doter de syst\u00e8mes capables de g\u00e9rer et de partager les informations g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es en interne et par des tiers, notamment les donn\u00e9es concernant leur tr\u00e9sorerie ou leur performance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les connaissances et les id\u00e9es des personnes, les informations sur les besoins et les demandes des usagers, les id\u00e9es qui leur parviennent de l'ext\u00e9rieur, etc. Les administrations utilisent de plus en plus les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et les pratiques d'externalisation ouverte pour \u00e9tablir des liens plus directs avec leurs usagers et solliciter plus activement l'avis des citoyens sur la fa\u00e7on d'am\u00e9liorer les services publics.", "Mais il ne suffit pas de partager des donn\u00e9es. Les structures doivent \u00eatre en mesure d'utiliser ces informations pour apporter des changements ; et devenir ainsi des centres de savoir. La gestion des connaissances est utile mais il faut aussi que cet apprentissage continu s'accompagne d'une culture interne. \nPar ailleurs, le partage des informations est essentiel pour augmenter le potentiel d'innovation et contribuer \u00e0 diffuser des id\u00e9es et des pratiques d'avenir au sein des diff\u00e9rentes organisations. Les initiatives de publication des donn\u00e9es publiques et de Big Data constituent de nouvelles sources d'informations publiques. Elles marquent \u00e9galement une nouvelle fa\u00e7on de partager ces informations avec les citoyens et les entreprises priv\u00e9es, qui peuvent, \u00e0 leur tour, les utiliser pour faire surgir des id\u00e9es, des services ou des produits innovants.", "4 Le projet du rapport complet a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Secr\u00e9tariat de l'OCDE et a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de l'apport des membres du groupe consultatif, dont M.
