In addition to the above the CPC is in the process of conducting a pilot project with the Office  of the State Prosecutor General (a similar project has been conducted for the judges as well) in  order to identify possible corruption risks (which entails also various manifestations of improper  influences by concerns of a political nature). The results will be the basis for an update of their  Integrity plans pursuant to GRECO Recommendation xvi:    “(i) that a policy for detecting and managing the risks and vulnerabilities of corruption in the  prosecution service be developed and made public and (ii) that the State Prosecutor General  and/or the State Prosecutorial Council be given the core responsibility and resources to manage  this policy and cooperate with other relevant institutions, including the Commission for the  Prevention of Corruption, in its oversight and implementation (paragraph 217);”

It is expected that a final questionnaire will be sent out in January 2015 and that the  results will give an empirical basis for the update of their Integrity plan(s).
