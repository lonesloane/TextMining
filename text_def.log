188.21000671|732.61|406.73201098|741.052|Box 9. The Innovation Imperative: A Call To Action  
59.54399871|708.49000488|168.6020061|716.93200488|ACTION 1: People Matter  
59.54399871|675.84999023|535.03700061|694.61199755|Governments must invest in the capacity and capabilities of civil servants as the catalysts of innovation. This  includes building the culture, incentives and norms to facilitate new ways of working.   
59.54399871|601.53999267|535.43501098|661.73199267|No government can build a strong and secure country without a professional, capable and innovative civil service. As  demands  on  the  public  sector  and  corresponding  resources  continue  to  move  in  opposing  directions,  an  innovative  public service will be increasingly vital to ensuring both domestic and global success. Given the far-reaching impact of  the  public  sector,  all  governments  have  a  stake  in  ensuring  that  their  public  services  are  equipped  with  the  skills,  incentives  and  scope  for  smart  risk  taking  and  problem  solving  to  spur  innovation  and  drive  better  outcomes  for  citizens.   
59.54399871|579.21998535|199.11200061|587.66198535|ACTION 2:  Knowledge is power  
59.54399871|546.70002685|535.05899871|565.46197314|Governments must facilitate the free flow of information, data and knowledge across the public sector and use  it to respond creatively to new challenges and opportunities.  
59.54399871|482.74000488|535.17998901|532.5820293|The information, data and knowledge that inform strategic and operational decision making are critical to fuelling public  sector innovation. Harnessing the innovative potential of information requires that information be open and available,  and  that organisations  carefully  consider  what  information  is  required and  how  best  to  systematically  integrate it into  the decision making process to support continuous learning. Organisations who fail to learn risk incurring higher costs  and repeating their errors, while failing to realise new possibilities.  
59.54399871|460.41999755|260.19200244|468.86199755|ACTION 3: Working together solves problems   
59.54399871|427.87998901|534.99599871|446.64199633|Governments must advance new organisational structures and leverage partnerships to enhance approaches  and tools, share risk and harness available information and resources for innovation.   
59.54399871|343.1599878|535.33898535|413.76199145|The complex problems faced by governments today require new ways of working. These include approaches based on  collaboration and partnership which integrate the vital perspectives of citizens, civil society, academia and business, as  well  as  exchange  within  the  public  sector.  Creating  more  open,  networked,  and  horizontal  organisations,  adept  at  collaboration  inside  and  outside  government  are  required. So  too are more  flexible  approaches  to  working,  including  pooling  talent  and  creating  multidisciplinary  management  teams  to  strengthen  collaboration.  Temporary  teams,  pilot  projects and short-term assignments are all ways for governments to experiment and better align talent and resources  to encourage dialogue, experimentation, risk-taking, problem-solving and innovation.  
59.54399871|320.9600061|295.59199633|329.4020061|ACTION 4: Rules and processes to support, not hinder  
59.54399871|287.92999267|534.96899871|307.2019939|Government  must  ensure  that  internal  rules  and  processes  are  balanced  in  their  capacity  to  mitigate  risks  while protecting resources and enabling innovation.  
59.54399871|224.33000122|535.39598657|274.17199511|While  internal  controls,  rules  and  processes  are  required  to  ensure  sound  stewardship  and  accountability,  they  can  inadvertently stifle innovation. To guard against this, governments must ensure that their public services are marked by  reasonable  rules  and  lean  processes.  Such  efforts  should  ensure  that  the  accountability  regime  is  both  robust  and  easy to navigate while also more systematically focused on enabling innovation. New outcome-focused approaches to  project management are one step in moving away from the rigidities of a command-and-control model.
